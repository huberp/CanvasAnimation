# 👋 @huberp - Analysis Complete!

I've finished investigating the convex decomposition algorithm bug. Here's what you need to know:

## 🐛 The Bug

Your algorithm produces **invalid 2-point polygons** for 18 of 19 sprites in the asteroid sprite sheet. These aren't real polygons - they're just line segments!

## 📸 Visual Proof

Check out the visual comparison I generated:
```
img/visualizations/decomposition-fix-comparison.png
```

It shows:
- **Top Left** (Current): Red dashed line = invalid 2-point polygon ❌
- **Top Right** (Option 1): Missing small feature (filtered)
- **Bottom Left** (Option 2): Green triangle preserved ✅
- **Bottom Right** (Hybrid - Recommended): Best of both worlds ⭐

## 🎯 Quick Decision Guide

I recommend the **Hybrid fix** because it:
- ✅ Fixes all invalid polygons
- ✅ Preserves sprite coverage  
- ✅ Simple implementation (5 lines)
- ✅ Low risk

**To approve**: Just comment "Hybrid" or "Approve Hybrid fix" on this PR

```

## ⚡ What Happens Next?

Once you comment with your choice:
1. I'll implement the fix (~10 min)
2. Regenerate all metadata (~5 min)
3. Run tests and security checks (~10 min)
4. Push the final changes

**Total time**: ~30 minutes

## 💬 Your Options

Comment on this PR with:
- **"Hybrid"** - Use recommended fix (I suggest this!)
- **"Option 1"** - Simplest but loses coverage
- **"Option 2"** - Preserve all features
- **"Option 3"** - Conservative area filtering
- **"I have questions"** - Ask anything!

## 📊 Quick Stats

**Current Output** (Buggy):
- 18 sprites with invalid 2-point polygons
- 1 sprite correct (already convex)

**With Hybrid Fix**:
- 0 sprites with invalid polygons ✅
- All sprites maintain proper coverage ✅
- Small features preserved as valid 3-point triangles ✅
